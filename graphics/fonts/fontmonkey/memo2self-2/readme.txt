MEMO TO SELFA true type font by P.D. Magnuswww.fontmonkey.comMemo to Self is a quick and dirty handwriting font. I scribbled it outin Freehand and adapted to TrueType using PfaEdit. There are glyphs forall standard keystrokes.This font is copyright 2002-12 by P.D. Magnus. 'Memo to self', 'Font Monkey', and'fecundity.com' are trademarks of P.D.
