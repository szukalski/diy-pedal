KIPFERLNA true type font by Cristyn and P.D. Magnuswww.fontmonkey.com

full internationl character set

It is effectively caps-only. However, many of the 'upper-case' letters are swoopy and extend out in one direction or the other; the 'lower-case' all lack swoops.
One day we were in a coffee shop, and Cristyn was jotting down notes in elaborate script. Later that evening, I sat her down in front of the computer and had her draw a complete set of glyphs. This is that font.
