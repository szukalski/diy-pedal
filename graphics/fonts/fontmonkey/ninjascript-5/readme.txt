NINJASCRIPTA true type font familyby P.D. Magnuswww.fontmonkey.comThe basic font has caps, full-keyboard, euro symbol, &c.  Like old school comic book lettering, it's caps only. A few characters  are slightly streamlined in the lower case.The bold style has alphanumeric with only some of the punctuation.The small caps font has a complete repertoire of accents, umlauts, &c.The untercase font has upper and lowercase and full international whatnots.  The italics for the untercase font have silly handdrawn serifs that are  the kind of thing I tend to do when lettering mild emphasis.I crafted this font for use in drawing Ninja Verses cartoons and subsequentlyused them for body text in the Decktet Book.The fonts might be good for any sort of comic work. For me, they have theadvantage of belonging to me and looking like my actual hand-writing.For you, they have the advantage of being the font you just downloaded.
