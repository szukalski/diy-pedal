To be clear: They do not cost anything.

If you do use them for something, though, I would love to here about it.
I would appreciate a sample of the thing for which you used the font, a
photo of it, or even just an e-mail telling me about it.

You can contact me via the website or by e-mail at pmagnus<at>fecundity.com

You are also encouraged to acknowledge fontmonkey or link to me, although
neither is strictly speaking required.

The font files may be freely distributed provided this license,
