STORKBILL SMALLCAPSA true type font by P.D. Magnuswww.fontmonkey.com

full-keyboard, plus the euro symbol and a few exotic bits of
punctuation
This was designed from the beginning as a small caps font. The
lower case glyphs are drawn in the same style and have the same line weight
as the upper case, rather than just being rescaled copies of the upper case
glyphs. It's somewhat rough in style, a close sibling of Spellstone.
