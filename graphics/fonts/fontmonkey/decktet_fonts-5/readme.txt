FORTUNE LETTERS and WIDGETS
true type fonts by P.D. Magnus
http://www.fontmonkey.com

http://www.fecundity.com/pmagnus/decktet

These two fonts are used in the design of the Decktet, a deck of esoteric cards.

FORTUNE LETTERS

This is a variant of the SPELLING SALT font. It has a few different characters
and the following Decktet-specific glyphs:

|     the divided dot used to indicate locations
^     the closed dot used to indicate events

FORTUNE WIDGETS

This is a dingbat font. It contains only the following Decktet-specific glyphs:

1-9   numerals (identical to numerals in the FORTUNE LETTERS font)
*     the Crown
#     the Pawn
%%    the Court
A-F   the six Decktet suits
U-Z   the six suits (longhand)
a-f   silhouettes of the six suits
[     'the' in the Decktet logo
]     'Decket' in the Decktet logo
@     my e-mail address

To make one of the suits, put the capital letter in black with the lower-case
letter in colour immediately underneath it. So a Moon is 'A' on top of 'a'.

Note that this is not the same as typing 'A' and then 'a' into a word processor.
It really requires either typesetting or a graphics program.

To make the Decktet logo, simply write '[ ]'.
