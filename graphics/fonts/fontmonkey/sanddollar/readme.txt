SAND DOLLAR
A true type font by P.D. Magnus
www.fontmonkey.com

This started out as a narrow, light, sans serif font. It wasn't working
out, so I added feet. The resulting font is like a distant cousin of
Spellstone-- perhaps it's the sort of font that Hobbits would use to label
wine bottles. It's a full-keyboard font, including everything down to
the euro symbol.
