The BRISCOE allcaps headline familySome true type fonts by P.D. Magnuswww.fontmonkey.com

BRISCOE DISPATCH is designed to look like an old, lead-type headline. Most
of the glyphs are pretty grungy.
BRISCOE CHRONICLE turns the grunge up a notch with angry slices out of all the glyphs.

Full keyboard, plus foreign currency and other whatnot.
