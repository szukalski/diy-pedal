Fontmonkey fonts are free for for all use, commercial or non-commercial.
To be clear: They do not cost anything.

If you do use them for something, though, I would love to here about it.
I would appreciate a sample of the thing for which you used the font, a
photo of it, or even just an e-mail telling me about it.

You can contact me via the website or by e-mail at pmagnus<at>fecundity.com

You are also encouraged to acknowledge fontmonkey or link to me, although
neither is strictly speaking required.

The font files may be freely distributed provided this license,
attribution to me, and the fontmonkey URL are included.
