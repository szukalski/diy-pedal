TYE PALOON regular and inverseA true type font by P.D. Magnuswww.fontmonkey.com

Tye Paloon plays at being a typewriter font the way that a child in a bathtub
might play at being a submarine. It is designed to be used at small point sizes for a rough, typeish look.

It is monospaced and includes alphanumeric plus ordinary typerwriter punctuation.
