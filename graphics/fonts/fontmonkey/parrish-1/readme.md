# Parrish House
a true type font by P.D. Magnus

This font began as a scan of an alphabet drawn by the illustrator Maxfield Parrish, published in the 1902 volume *Letters & Lettering* by Frank Chouteau Brown. 

The plate is labelled, "Alphabet used for quick lettering on plans, packages." Brown writes that its "its very charm lies in its informality."

Parrish's alphabet had neither an uppercase N, numerals, nor any punctuation besides a period and a comma. I have endeavoured to extrapolate what those might look like.

The name 'Parrish House' was the first autocomplete suggestion starting with 'Parrish'.
