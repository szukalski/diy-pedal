SOUR MILKA true type font by P.D. Magnuswww.fontmonkey.comThere is an old lady who goes to the village and tries to sell her jam,but people prefer to buy jam from the hobbits who live under the hill.So she pretends that the jam she is selling is hobbit-made. She lettersthe labels in the best imitation of hobbit script that she can muster,and this is what it looks like.This font is copyright 2013 by P.D. Magnus.
