WHICKERISH ALLCAPSA true type font by P.D. Magnuswww.fontmonkey.comWhickerish Allcaps is a font which an old man keeps on his front porch. During the summer, he sits on it, sipping iced tea and saying hello to anyone who walks buy. During the winter, he covers it with a tarp.LICENSEThis font is copyright 2015 by P.D.
